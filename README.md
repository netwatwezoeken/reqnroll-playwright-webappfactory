This demo shows the integration of Reqnroll with PlayWright and ASP.NET Integration tests.

For easy setup it uses my the [Nwwz.Mvc.Testing NuGet package](https://github.com/netwatwezoeken/Mvc.Testing)

The project under test is one of the Blazor Web App templates that came with .NET 8. Apart from one change in `Program.cs` the folder of interest is `test/Integration`

Feel free to ask questions, make a remark or to contribute.
